Thank you for your interest in `tessera`! We welcome all forms of contributions, including but not limited to code, documentation, and issues.

## Development Tools

If you need to contribute code to `tessera`, in addition to the latest stable Rust, it is highly recommended to install the following tools:

- [`xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-mobile/xbuild): We use it to build and test the Android version. In the future, it may also be used for iOS compatibility.
- [`rust-script`](https://rust-script.org/#installation): We use it to run [some rust scripts](./scripts). It is helpful for development.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

To ensure code quality and consistency, and to keep the repository clean, please follow these guidelines:

## Getting Started

You can set up your development environment in one of three ways:

1. **Nix (Recommended)**: For a one-liner setup on Linux and macOS.
2. **Bootstrap Scripts**: Automated scripts for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
3. **Manual Setup**: Step-by-step instructions for each OS.

### Option A - Nix package manager (Recommended)

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed, you can get a development shell with all dependencies ready by running:

```bash
nix develop            # Desktop dev shell
nix develop .#android  # Android dev shell
```

### Option B - Bootstrap Scripts

We provide scripts to automate the setup process on major operating systems. The Linux script will attempt to detect your display server (X11 or Wayland) and install only the necessary dependencies.

- **Windows**:
  Open a PowerShell terminal and run:

  ```powershell
  .\scripts\bootstrap.ps1
  ```

- **Linux / macOS**:
  Open a terminal and run:

  ```bash
  bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
  ```

These scripts will attempt to install Rust and other required dependencies for you.

### Option C - Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up your environment manually, follow the instructions for your operating system below.

#### 1. Install Rust

First, install the Rust toolchain by following the official instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### 2. Install System Dependencies

##### For Linux

On Linux, you need to install development packages for either X11 or Wayland, depending on which display server you are using. You typically only need one set of packages.

- **For X11**:

  - _Debian/Ubuntu_: `sudo apt install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev`
  - _Arch/Manjaro_: `sudo pacman -S libx11 libxrandr libxcursor`
  - _Fedora_: `sudo dnf install libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXcursor-devel`

- **For Wayland**:
  - _Debian/Ubuntu_: `sudo apt install libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev`
  - _Arch/Manjaro_: `sudo pacman -S wayland libxkbcommon`
  - _Fedora_: `sudo dnf install wayland-devel libxkbcommon-devel`

##### For macOS

No additional system dependencies are required if you have installed the Xcode Command Line Tools.

##### For Windows

No additional dependencies are required after installing Rust. The necessary tools are included with the standard Rust installation for Windows.

#### 3. Install Vulkan SDK (Optional)

The Vulkan SDK is **optional**. It is only required if you need to perform shader validation or debugging. For general UI development, you can skip this step.

If you need it, you can download it from [vulkan.lunarg.com](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/), run the installer, and follow its post-install instructions.

### Language for Code

All code, including documentation within the code (like `rustdoc` comments) and comments, must be written in English, unless a feature specifically requires pointing out a word in another language.

### Code Checks

- Please ensure your code format complies with the project's specifications. The rules are as follows:

  - `rustfmt edition 2024` default rules.
  - `5 use import rules`:
    1. Imports are divided into four groups, arranged in the following strict order:
       - Group 1: Standard library (`std`, `core`, `alloc`)
       - Group 2: Third-party crates
       - Group 3: Current crate root (`crate::`)
       - Group 4: Submodules of the current crate (`super::`, `self::`)
    2. There must be exactly one blank line between different groups.
    3. Imports within the same group must be arranged consecutively without any blank lines.
    4. Imports within each group must be sorted alphabetically.
    5. Imports from the same root path should be merged into a single `use` statement.

- **Formatting Tools**

  - You can use the `cargo fmt` command to format your code. This will automatically apply the first formatting rule mentioned above.
  - However, it is recommended to always use the following command (at the project root):

    ```bash
    rust-script scripts/check-imports.rs . --fix
    ```

  - Nix users: just type `fmt` inside `nix develop` - it's a smart alias that runs the same command above from any directory

    This command checks and fixes import rules, and also calls `rustfmt` for formatting. It directly applies all the formatting rules mentioned above and does not ignore script files (whereas `cargo fmt` only formats what is managed by `Cargo.toml`).

### Commit Guidelines

- Please ensure your commit messages are clear, concise, and describe the changes made.
- The commit format must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification. We have no special requirements for the scope; you can omit it, but it is recommended to identify the scope or feature of the change.
- Before pushing, please ensure:
  - Your code passes all tests (`cargo test`).
  - You have updated relevant documentation (if applicable).
  - Your code complies with the [Code Check Guidelines](#code-checks).

## Documentation Contribution Guidelines

To ensure the clarity and consistency of the documentation and to enable project collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

### Language for Documentation

All documentation content, including READMEs, Wiki pages, and other documents, must have at least an English version, which is considered the primary version. Other i18n versions can be translated from the English version, but it must be ensured that the English version always exists and its content is the most up-to-date.

Note that because `cargo doc` generated documentation does not support i18n at all, and we cannot put all versions of the documentation in the code, please do not add any non-English documentation content in the code.

### Documentation Translation Guidelines

- Documentation translation must be based on the English version, ensuring that the translated content is consistent with the English version.
- The English version of the documentation does not need an i18n suffix. Other language versions need to have the corresponding language suffix added to the filename, such as `README_zh-CN.md`.
- It is recommended that translated documents are not placed directly in the same directory as the English version, but in a relative `docs` folder, unless absolutely necessary.

### Documentation Format

It is best to pass a markdown lint, but we do not strictly require it. Please ensure the documentation is clear, readable, and consistently formatted.

### Documentation Commits

- For direct commits/PRs to this repository, please refer to the [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines).
- For commits to related repositories, such as the official website, Wiki, etc., please follow their respective contribution guidelines.

## Special Note on Android Builds

Building for Android requires some specific considerations due to the limitations of `NativeActivity`. We use [`xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-mobile/xbuild) to handle the complexity of cross-compilation and packaging.

- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the Android NDK and SDK correctly set up.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter issues during an Android build, `xbuild` provides a diagnostic tool. Run the following command to check your environment and identify potential problems:

  ```bash
  x doctor
  ```

- **Nix Users**: The Android development shell (`nix develop .#android`) comes with `xbuild` pre-configured.

Please note that Android support is still experimental and you might encounter issues.

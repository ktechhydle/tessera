      **Mandatory Pre-computation Step:**
      Before starting any coding task, you **must** first read and fully understand the project documentation located in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

      If you encounter any discrepancies between the documentation and the code, or if your work requires changes to the documented architecture, you **must** update the documentation accordingly. Maintaining documentation-code consistency is a primary directive.
